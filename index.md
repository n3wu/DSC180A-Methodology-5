Section: A10 - Ethical Considerations in Using Artificial Intelligence

Mentor: Emily Ramond, Rasmus Sloth Nielsen

Questions:
1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?


The most interesting topic was fairness metrics because it had so many nuances and was completely new to me.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.


I would like to pursue a more economical topic, such as if bias exists in credit scoring or resource allocation. For these cases, I would consider race, age, or geographic location as sources of bias and use that as the basis for the project.

3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?


It's sort of unclear what is meant by "approach," but if it encompasses anything about the project, I would want to be more involved in the coding because while our team's roles are split, it is a lot easier to write an analysis when you know everything about the code.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?


I would be interested in using econometric techniques in the project if applicable, as I want to see if I can apply knowledge from my minor.
