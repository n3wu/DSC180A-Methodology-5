Section: A10 - Ethical Considerations in Using Artificial Intelligence

Mentor: Emily Ramond, Rasmus Sloth Nielsen

Questions:

What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
- The most interesting topic was fairness metrics because it had so many nuances and was completely new to me.

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
- I would like to pursue a more economical topic, such as if bias exists in credit scoring or resource allocation. For these cases, I would consider race, age, or geographic location as sources of bias and use that as the basis for the project.

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
- It's sort of unclear what is meant by "approach," but if it encompasses anything about the project, I would want to be more involved in the coding because while our team's roles are split, it is a lot easier to write an analysis when you know everything about the code.

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
- I would be interested in using econometric techniques in the project if applicable, as I want to see if I can apply knowledge from my minor.
